BhDebugInfo for Gideros 
=======================

A debug information HUD for Gideros apps. Simply include BhDebugInfo.lua (and Fonts/Tahoma.ttf)
in your project and the HUD will appear at the top of the screen. Note, text is in black and you
may have to change this to make it readable, depending on your app. To remove the HUD, right click
on the BhDebugInfo.lua file in the Gideros IDE and choose "Exclude from Execution".
